Bainsdown Ltd (s MA);KALLERED;SE;Public Pension Fund;S.12901;29-Oct-99;Mar-19;The Bank of England pension scheme is a defined benefit scheme which provides benefits for employees of the Bank of England. ONS has assessed the classification status of the scheme and has concluded that Bank of England Pension Fund Trustees Ltd. is the scheme's Pension Administrator; as it was created with the sole purpose of acting as the trustee for the scheme. As a majority of the trustees are appointed by the Bank of England (which is classified as a public financial corporation (S.121)); this has led to the trustees being classified within the Public Pension Funds subsector (S.12901) with effect from 29 October 1999; the date Bank of England Pension Fund Trustees Ltd. was incorporated. ONS has also determined that the Pension Manager is the Bank of England as it bears responsibility for the Scheme's policy and strategy; and ultimate responsibility for the scheme.;;

Bournemouth Airport Property Investments (Offices) Ltd;Public Pension Fund;S.12901;29-Sep-08;Feb-16;Bradford & Bingley plc is a public limited company and primarily operates as a servicer of mortgage loans secured on residential properties and of associated services. Following the financial crisis it transferred into public ownership and is currently classified in Central Government. Bradford & Bingley and its subsidiaries operated a defined benefit pension scheme; which entered into a Crown Guarantee on 29 September 2008. ONS assessed the Bradford & Bingley crown guarantee arrangement in accordance with internationally agreed rules in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and accompanying Manual on Government Deficit and Debt 2014 (MGDD 2014). ONS concluded that (i) the Bradford & Bingley Pension Scheme was the pension administrator in the public pension fund (S.12901) and (ii) HM Treasury was the scheme’s pensioner manager in the central government subsector (S.1311). This means any difference between the pension entitlements and the assets held by the Scheme will be attributed to the central government subsector as an asset/liability.;;;;;;;
