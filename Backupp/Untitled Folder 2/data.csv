Based on provisions contained within the Ports Act 1991, these were previously classified as public non-financial corporations (S.11001). The Scottish Government introduced new legislation in 2015 (the Harbours (Scotland) Act) to repeal sections of the Ports Act 1991 with a view to removing public sector control of Scottish Trust Ports. Following consideration of this legislation, ONS concluded that the Scottish Trust Ports are no longer subject to public sector controls. Scottish Trust Ports are now classified as private non-financial corporations, with this decision effective from 2 December 2015.;

Airport Driving Range Company Limited;Public Non-Financial Corporation;S.11001;22-Nov-13;Nov-15;"On 14 November 2013, the Scottish Government purchased TS Prestwick Holdco Limited (formerly Macrocom Limited) and used it as a vehicle to acquire Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited, the parent company of Glasgow Prestwick Airport Limited and other subsidiaries.  Collectively, this group of subsidiaries own and operate Glasgow Prestwick Airport Limited.  In conjunction with reviewing the statistical classification of Glasgow Prestwick Airport Limited following this intervention, the ONS also assessed the classification of all subsidiaries within the group.  Assessment was conducted in accordance with internationally agreed rules in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and accompanying Manual on Government Deficit and Debt 2014 (MGDD 2014).  The following conclusions were made; - Both TS Prestwick Holdco Limited and Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited should be classified as public holding companies as they meet the description of holding companies provided in ESA 2010 para. 2.14 and are subject to public sector control through share ownership and board appointments (by proxy).  In accordance with MGDD I.6.2, 15-18, both units are to be recorded in the central government (S.1311) subsector as captive financial institutions. - Both Glasgow Prestwick Airport Limited and Prestwick Airport Limited should be classified as public non-financial corporations.  This was due to the fact that both units charge economically significant prices, pass the market test detailed in ESA 2010 3.33, and are subject to public sector control through board appointments and share ownership (by proxy). - Each of Airport Driving Range Company Limited, Prestwick Airport Property Limited and Prestwick Airport Infrastructure Limited meet the description of artificial subsidiaries provided in ESA 2010, 2.24-2.26.  Consequently, they will each be consolidated with their parent unit(s) as public non-financial corporations. All classification decisions apply from 22 November 2013, the date TS Prestwick Holdco Limited purchased Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited.";

Bank of England Pension Scheme (also known as the Bank of England Pension Fund);Public Pension Fund;S.12901;29-Oct-99;Mar-19;The Bank of England pension scheme is a defined benefit scheme which provides benefits for employees of the Bank of England. ONS has assessed the classification status of the scheme and has concluded that Bank of England Pension Fund Trustees Ltd. is the scheme's Pension Administrator, as it was created with the sole purpose of acting as the trustee for the scheme. As a majority of the trustees are appointed by the Bank of England (which is classified as a public financial corporation (S.121)), this has led to the trustees being classified within the Public Pension Funds subsector (S.12901) with effect from 29 October 1999, the date Bank of England Pension Fund Trustees Ltd. was incorporated. ONS has also determined that the Pension Manager is the Bank of England as it bears responsibility for the Scheme's policy and strategy, and ultimate responsibility for the scheme.;

Bradford & Bingley Pension Scheme;Public Pension Fund;S.12901;29-Sep-08;Feb-16;Bradford & Bingley plc is a public limited company and primarily operates as a servicer of mortgage loans secured on residential properties and of associated services. Following the financial crisis it transferred into public ownership and is currently classified in Central Government. Bradford & Bingley and its subsidiaries operated a defined benefit pension scheme, which entered into a Crown Guarantee on 29 September 2008. ONS assessed the Bradford & Bingley crown guarantee arrangement in accordance with internationally agreed rules in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and accompanying Manual on Government Deficit and Debt 2014 (MGDD 2014). ONS concluded that (i) the Bradford & Bingley Pension Scheme was the pension administrator in the public pension fund (S.12901) and (ii) HM Treasury was the scheme’s pensioner manager in the central government subsector (S.1311). This means any difference between the pension entitlements and the assets held by the Scheme will be attributed to the central government subsector as an asset/liability.;

ONS formally reviewed the classification of the body, to see whether under European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and accompanying Manual on Government Deficit and Debt 2014 (MGDD 2014) it should be classified as a public financial corporation or a central government body. It was concluded that it was a public financial corporation with effect from 1985.;

Based on provisions contained within the Ports Act 1991, these were previously classified as public non-financial corporations (S.11001). The Scottish Government introduced new legislation in 2015 (the Harbours (Scotland) Act) to repeal sections of the Ports Act 1991 with a view to removing public sector control of Scottish Trust Ports. Following consideration of this legislation, ONS concluded that the Scottish Trust Ports are no longer subject to public sector controls. Scottish Trust Ports are now classified as private non-financial corporations, with this decision effective from 2 December 2015.;

Canal & River Trust;Public Non-Financial Corporation;S.11001;2-Jul-12;Sep-15;The British Waterways Board (BWB) was restructured on 2nd July 2012, and its English and Welsh operations transferred to a new charity called the Canal & River Trust (CRT). In accordance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and the accompanying 2014 Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD 2014), it was judged that the Canal & River Trust is a market body because there is sufficient evidence to suggest it charges economically significant prices and passes the quantitative market test. The Canal & River Trust is judged to be under government control in particular through the provisions of enabling instruments whereby the Secretary of State for the Environment and Rural Affairs has the power to approve or deny certain corporate decisions (e.g. dissolution). The Canal & River Trust is therefore classified as a public non-financial corporation (S.11001).;

Based on provisions contained within the Ports Act 1991, these were previously classified as public non-financial corporations (S.11001). The Scottish Government introduced new legislation in 2015 (the Harbours (Scotland) Act) to repeal sections of the Ports Act 1991 with a view to removing public sector control of Scottish Trust Ports.

Combined Authorities in England;Local Government;S.1313;12-Nov-09;Jun-19;Combined Authorities (CAs) are the bodies formed by two or more local authorities wishing to work more closely together to make collective decisions on key policy areas such as economic development, transport, skills, health and social care. ONS has assessed the classification status of CAs and has concluded that they are subject to public sector control as their corporate policy is determined by government and the majority of their members must be councillors appointed by the councils representing the respective local authorities. The assessment also concluded that as all CAs are funded almost entirely by non-competitive grants from government, they are not market producers. As all CAs are formed under the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (the 2009 Act), they have been classified en-bloc to the Local Government subsector (S.1313) with effect from 12 November 2009, the date the 2009 Act received Royal Assent.;

It was judged that DPEC remained under government control, in accordance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and the accompanying 2014 Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD 2014). This is through the government having control over the appointment of key personnel and guaranteeing funding to ensure that any net deficit, including pension liabilities, will be fully funded by the government until DPEC is closed down. DPEC no longer provides market services, and therefore it is reclassified to the central government subsector (S.1311). ";

Disclosure and Barring Service;Central Government;S.1311;1-Dec-12;Nov-15;In July 2014, ONS announced that the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) would be classified as a Public Non-Financial Corporation (S.11001). This was based on the fact that the fees DBS charges for disclosure checks are in proportion to the services the organisation produces (rather than raising revenues to be passed to other areas of government).  Following advice from Eurostat, the ONS has now completed a further analysis of the services DBS produces and has found that checks provided to government customers plus checks provided to certain customers free of charge (as a result of government policy) comprise a majority of the output produced by the DBS.  Checks provided to government customers is a proxy for non-market output in the context of ESA 2010 20.27, while checks provided free of charge are secondary non-market output.  As such, a majority of DBS activity is non-market production and DBS is therefore 'presumed' to be a non-market producer in accordance with the principles laid out in ESA 2010 20.27.  As a result, the DBS is a government-controlled non-market body and is reclassified in the Central Government subsector (S.1311) from its inception in December 2012. ;

Based on provisions contained within the Ports Act 1991, these were previously classified as public non-financial corporations (S.11001). The Scottish Government introduced new legislation in 2015 (the Harbours (Scotland) Act) to repeal sections of the Ports Act 1991 with a view to removing public sector control of Scottish Trust Ports. Following consideration of this legislation, ONS concluded that the Scottish Trust Ports are no longer subject to public sector controls. Scottish Trust Ports are now classified as private non-financial corporations, with this decision effective from 2 December 2015.;

In accordance with internationally agreed rules outlined in ESA 2010 and MGDD 2014, ONS concluded that ECML Company Ltd should be reclassified as a Private Non-Financial Corporation (S.11002);  this was due to the fact that public sector control over ECML Company Ltd is no longer evident and that it continues to act as a market producer. Entries in the Public Sector Classifications Guide have been updated to reflect this reclassification, recording ECML Company Ltd as a Former Public Non-Financial Corporation, effective 1 March 2015.
